> The equity risk premium puzzle - A cross-country study of asset returns, growth and disaster risk

To rationalize the high observed average excess returns across 16 developed economies I obtained historical financial data and macroeconomic aggregates spanning almost 150 years and calibrated a rich preference specification of the Epstein-Zin-Weil form with the corresponding empirical disaster risk moments, following the disaster risk approach initally proposed by <a href = "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0304393288901729" target="_blank">Rietz (1988)</a> and further developed by <a href = "https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3208215/Barro_RareDisasters.pdf" target="_blank">Barro (2006)</a>.

I show that accounting for disaster risk does indeed attenuate the puzzle and decreases the implied coefficients of relative risk aversion by 72% for consumption data and 69% for GDP data on average relative to the original, "benchmark" model used by Mehra and Prescott in their famous seminal paper [<a href = "https://www.academicwebpages.com/preview/mehra/pdf/The%20Equity%20Premium%20A%20Puzzle.pdf" target="_blank">Mehra, R. and Prescott, E.C. (1985)</a>]

Moreover, I assert how cross-sectional estimates of risk aversion are functions of additional factors reflecting the economic environment e.g. w.r.t. fiscal capacity and liquidity risk after controlling for disaster risk.
