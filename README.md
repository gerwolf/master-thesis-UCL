> The equity risk premium puzzle - A cross-country study of asset returns, growth and disaster risk

To rationalize the high observed average excess returns across 16 developed economies I obtained historical financial data and macroeconomic aggregates spanning almost 150 years and calibrated a rich preference specification of the Epstein-Zin-Weil form with the corresponding empirical disaster risk moments, following the disaster risk approach initally proposed by Rietz and further developed by Barro.

I show that accounting for disaster risk does indeed attenuate the puzzle and decreases the implied coefficients of relative risk aversion by 72% for consumption data and 69% for GDP data on average relative to the original, "benchmark" model used by Mehra & Prescott in their famous seminal paper (Mehra & Prescott, 1985)
